The rheological results indicated that high solid\\nloading (72 wt%) titania ceramic ink whose shear elastic modulus reached approximately 106 Pa in the\\nlinear viscoelastic region was the optimal ceramic ink for direct ink writing, due to its good shear\\nthinning and viscoelastic behavior. High solid loading (72 wt%) titania ceramic ink was utilized to\\nfabricate three dimensional titania ceramic parts, and a series of test methods were employed to examine\\nthe related properties of titania ceramics sintered at different temperatures including the volumetric\\nshrinkage, porosity, density, microstructures, compressive strength and elastic modulus. The results\\nshowed that the volumetric shrinkage and density increased when increasing the sintering tempera-\\ntures, and the opposite phenomenon was found in porosity of titania ceramic. When the sintering\\ntemperature was 1300 �C, the compressive strength was about 125.00 MPa. The elastic modulus of titania\\nceramics sintered at different temperatures (from 1000 �C to 1400 �C) was between 1.22 GPa and\\n6.87 GPa.\\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The ideal ink suitable for printing three dimensional ceramic\\nparts has to meet related rheological properties requirements.

In the previous studies on alumina, titania and other ce-\\nramics fabricated by direct ink writing, the solid content of ceramic\\nink was relatively low [13,20,21]. However, higher solid loading\\nceramic ink is more favorable for ceramic forming by direct ink\\nwriting, because it is beneﬁcial to increase the supportability of\\nceramic green body and improve the mechanical properties of ce-\\nramics. Organic or inorganic additives act as rheology modiﬁers in\\nceramic ink for direct ink writing. There are many kinds of rheology\\nmodiﬁers for ceramic fabricated by direct ink writing, including\\nPAA, PEG, PVP, etc [12,13,22]. The type and amount of organic or\\ninorganic additives should be determined according to the actual\\nsituation.\\nMoreover, titania is a kind of functional inorganic material, its\\nbiocompatibility, bioactivity and stability contribute to integrating\\nwith bone safely and promoting direct contact between bone tissue\\nand bone implant, so it is believed to be a promising biomaterial for\\nbone implant [23e25]. Titania ceramic materials created by direct\\nink writing technology with gel-sol ink performed good biocom-\\npatibility and contributed to cell growth [26]. However, it is crucial\\nfor biomaterials that not only possess bioactivity and safety but\\nappropriate mechanical properties [27]. Conventional biomaterials\\nsuch as stainless steel, titanium alloy have been widely used as\\nbone implants due to their biocompatibility and high mechanical\\nstrength [28,29]. However, high mechanical strength of these alloy\\nmaterials can cause bone resorption and stress shielding between\\nimplants and surrounding bone tissue once implanted, these\\nintractable problems will affect the rehabilitation effect of patients\\n[30]. Titania as a bone implant material with prominent biomedical\\nproperties, which has huge potential application in bone implant\\nand can be a competitive candidate in the ﬁeld of biomaterials. So it\\nis necessary to investigate mechanical properties of 3D printed\\ntitania ceramic parts to better match the surrounding bone tissue,\\nthen effectively reduce bone resorption and stress shielding\\nphenomenon.\\nResearch on related mechanical properties of titania ceramic\\nparts fabricated through 3D printing is still insufﬁcient, and it is\\nworthy\\nto\\npay\\nmore\\nattention.\\nIn\\nthis\\nwork,\\nan\\nadditive\\nmanufacturing way of titania ceramic was reported, the rheological\\nproperties of different ceramic inks were studied, the related me-\\nchanical properties and micrographs of titania ceramic structures\\ngenerated by 3D printing were investigated. The elastic modulus of\\ntitania ceramics was between 1.22 GPa and 6.87 GPa, which was\\nclose to the elastic modulus of high density cancellous bone that\\nwas in a range of 0.28 GPa and 1.86 GPa, and this was important for\\nbone implant materials [31].\\nCommercially available rutile titania powder with an average\\nparticle size of 0.36 mm (high purity 99.9%) was purchased from\\nNingbo Xinfu Titanium Dioxide Co. Ltd., China. The detailed phys-\\nical properties of titania powder were illustrated in Fig. S1, Fig. S2\\nand Fig. S3. Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP, CP) and sodium\\nalginate (SA, CP) were available from the Sinopharm Chemical Re-\\nagent Company (Shanghai, China). Deionized (DI) water from a\\nMillipore-Q puriﬁcation system (Millipore, USA) with a resistivity\\nof 18.2 MU cm was utilized during this work.\\n2.2. Preparation of titania ceramic ink\\nTitania powder should be fully dried in the drying oven before\\nuse to ensure accuracy during the weighing process. Titania\\nceramic ink used to fabricate titania ceramic parts by direct ink\\nwriting was prepared by mixing uniformly an appropriate amount\\nof titania powder, deionized water, sodium hexametaphosphate\\nand sodium alginate. Sodium alginate and deionized water were\\nused as binder and solvent, respectively. Sodium hexametaphos-\\nphate was used as dispersant, which could reduce particle\\nagglomeration and contribute to improving ceramic powders\\ncontent. It was necessary to completely dissolve sodium alginate\\nand sodium hexametaphosphate in deionized water ﬁrst during the\\nexperiment, which was beneﬁcial to the better mixing of ceramic\\npowders in the subsequent experimental steps. In order to obtain\\nhomogeneous and stable titania ceramic ink, the mixture should be\\nstirred thoroughly at room temperature for 6 h using mechanical\\nstirrer. Finally, the titania ceramic ink consisting of sodium hex-\\nametaphosphate and sodium alginate was vibrated for 30 min and\\nfollowed by sonication. The composition of ceramic ink with\\ndifferent content was shown in Table 1.\\n2.3. Direct ink writing\\nTitania ceramic structures were fabricated with ceramic inks of\\noptimized rheological behavior by a computer-aid design and\\ncomputer-aid manufacturing device. The titania ceramic ink was\\nﬁlled in a 500 ml plastic syringe and passed through the nozzle at\\nroom temperature under the conditions of room temperature and\\nnormal pressure, three dimensional titania ceramic parts were\\ncreated by continuous ﬁlaments via layer-by-layer deposition pro-\\ncess, as shown in Fig. 1. During the printing process, the ceramic\\ninks ﬂow rate was controlled by a stepper motor, the nozzle with a\\ndiameter of 1 mm or 2 mm was used to fabricate three dimensional\\ntitania ceramic parts at the printing speed of 5 mm s�1. The nozzle\\nwas incrementally moved along the Z axis direction once the un-\\nderlying layer was ﬁnished and this process was repeated until the\\ndesired 3D titania ceramic structures were completed.

All specimens were printed with a layer thickness of\\n2 mm, which was equal to the nozzle diameter (2 mm).\\nAll the printed titania ceramic samples were dried in the drying\\noven at 50 �C for 24 h in order to be fully dried. Before this, the size\\nof simples should be measured with vernier caliper to prepare for\\nthe subsequent calculation of the shrinkage of the samples.

The sintering temperatures were set to 1000 �C, 1100 �C,\\n1200 �C, 1300 �C and 1400 �C, respectively. The sintering procedure\\nwas increased from room temperature to sintering temperature\\nwith a heating rate 10 �C min�1 and held at sintering temperature\\nfor three hours. After the sintering process was ﬁnished, the titania\\nceramic parts fabricated by direct ink writing were cooled to room\\ntemperature at an air atmosphere in the furnace and then the size\\nof samples should be measured.\\n2.4. Physical and mechanical characterization\\nThe rheological properties of titania ceramic ink were measured\\nusing a rotational rheometer (Haake RS6000, Thermoﬁsher Co. Ltd.,\\nGermany) equipped with a parallel plate geometry (PP15ER,\\ndiameter of 15 mm, and gap of 1 mm). Steady state ﬂow and the\\noscillatory\\nmode\\nwere\\nemployed\\nduring\\nrheological\\nmeasurements. Viscosity and shear stress were measured as a\\nfunction of steady shear rate increasing from 0.1 s�1e1000 s�1 us-\\ning steady state ﬂow mode. Shear elastic modulus (G0) was\\nmeasured as a function of stress amplitude range of 1 Pa to 1000 Pa\\nthrough oscillatory logarithmic stress sweep mode at the frequency\\nof 1 Hz and a ﬁxed strain of 0.4%. All tests were performed at room\\ntemperature.\\nThe shrinkage of samples was calculated based on the difference\\nin size of before and after sintering. The porosity and bulk density\\nwere measured using the Archimedes method. X-ray diffraction\\n(XRD) (D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) was used to identify the\\nphases present in the sintered samples, using Cu Ka radiation\\n(l ¼ 0.15406 nm) at a scanning rate of 0.19� s�1 in the 2q range\\n20e80�. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi\\nS-4800, Japan) was utilized to observe microstructures of titania\\nceramic parts generated by direct ink writing. The mechanical\\nproperties of the printed titania ceramic rod samples were tested\\nby a universal testing machine (CMT-5105, Shenzhen MTS Com-\\npany). The test specimens were sanded by sandpapers to ensure\\nthat the two tested ends were ﬂat and parallel. Finally, in order to\\nensure reliability of compressive strengths, ﬁve samples at each\\nsintering temperature were tested.\\n3. Results and discussion\\n3.1. Rheological properties of titania ceramic ink\\nThe rheological properties of the titania ceramic ink with\\ndifferent component content were illustrated in Fig. 2. Sodium\\nalginate (SA) acted as a binder in this paper, which was a type of\\ngelling polysaccharide most isolated from brown kelp, and it could\\nbe dissolved in water at room temperature to form a viscous liquid\\n[33]. Its bonding property was used to effectively bond titania\\ninorganic powder, which was beneﬁcial to the molding of ceramic\\nmaterials. Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) was used as an\\nanionic\\ndispersant,\\nwhose\\nmain\\ndispersion\\nmechanism\\nwas\\nimproving the repulsion of inorganic particles [34]. As shown in\\nFig. 2(a) and (b), SHMP dispersant signiﬁcantly reduced the vis-\\ncosities and shear elastic modulus of titania ceramic ink. It was\\nobvious that the viscosities and shear elastic modulus of titania\\nceramic ink gradually increased with the increase of SA binder, as\\nshown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The ratio of dispersant and binder should\\nbe decided based on these rheological results. The rheological\\nproperties of the titania ceramic ink were also closely related to the\\ncontent of titania ceramic powder, as shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f).\\nTitania ceramic ink with different solid content all showed obvious\\nshear thinning behavior with increasing shear rate, and the vis-\\ncosities decreased sharply. When the shear rate was too small or at\\nrest, the particles in the ceramic ink were intertwined with each\\nother and have a large viscosity. However, the particles in the\\nceramic ink were subjected to the shear stress during different ﬂow\\nlayers when increasing the shear rate, which weakened entangle-\\nment of particles and caused shear thinning behavior [35,36]. For\\nexample, the viscosity of high solid loading (72 wt%) titania ceramic\\nink decreased from about 4000 Pas to 60 Pas when shear rate\\nincreased from 0.1 s�1 to 21.0 s�1. The rheological behavior of\\nceramic ink shear thinning was vital for direct ink writing, which\\ncould ensure that the ceramic ink pass through the pipe and the\\nnozzle smoothly without clogging under certain external force.\\nViscosities of high solid loading titania ceramic ink were higher\\nthan low solid loading ceramic ink at same shear rates. For example,\\nviscosity of ceramic ink with 56 wt% titania powder content were\\napproximately 180 Pa s at shear rate of 0.1 s�1. However, for ceramic\\nink with a solid content of 72 wt%, the viscosity reached about\\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of direct ink writing.\\nT. Chen et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 783 (2019) 321e328\\x0c4000 Pas when the shear rate was 0.1 s�1. Above results indicated\\nthat titania powder content played an important role in effectively\\nadjusting the viscosity of ceramic ink, high solid loading titania\\nceramic ink was more viscous and needed a larger stress to make it\\nﬂow. To make the ceramic ink perform shear thinning behavior, the\\nyield stress (ty) must be overcome, which can be described by\\nHerschel-Bulkey [37] equation:\\nt ¼ ty þ k _gn\\nHere, t is the shear stress, n is the shear thinning exponent (<1), k is\\nthe viscosity parameter, and _g is the shear rate. When stress is\\nbeyond yield stress, titania ceramic inks exhibit shear thinning\\nphenomenon due to attrition between ceramic particles and ad-\\nditives. It can be understood that yield stress is the shear stress\\nwhen shear rate is close to zero, and it is a critical point to push\\nceramic inks ﬂow. According to Herschel-Bulkey equation, shear\\nstress performs an increasing trend and then approximately rea-\\nches a relative stable platform. The relationship between shear\\nstress and shear rate which is in line with the general trend of\\nEquation (1) is can be understood with the help of Fig. 2(e).\\nAn appropriate elastic modulus is important for the ceramic ink\\nto maintain its shape after the ceramic ink is extruded from the\\nnozzle. According to the past research on colloidal ink for direct ink\\nwriting, whether the elastic modulus of ceramic ink is suitable for\\ndirect ink writing can be evaluated by the equation [38,39]:\\ny ¼ k\\n \\n∅\\n∅gel\\n!x\\nwhere y is the elastic property of interest (shear yield stress (ty) or\\nelastic modulus (G0)), k is a constant, x is the scaling exponent\\n(~2.5), ∅gel is a critical volume fraction which is known as the gel\\npoint, ∅ is the colloid volume fraction. The elastic properties of\\ncolloidal ink are mainly determined by two parameters: ∅, which is\\nproportional to bond density, and ∅ gel, which is inversely pro-\\nportional to bond strength. Here, we can also use this model to\\nevaluate whether titania ceramic ink is suitable for direct ink\\nwriting. As illustrated in Fig. 3, ceramic green body fabricated by\\nceramic ink with 56 wt% titania or 60 wt% titania collapsed and\\ndeformed greatly. When titania content of ceramic ink reached\\n64 wt% or above this value, a complete ceramic green body could be\\nformed by direct ink writing. We could regard 64 wt% titania of\\nceramic ink as a critical mass fraction. In order to match better with\\nthe model for evaluating the suitability of titania ceramic ink, we\\nconverted the mass fraction of titania ceramic ink into volume\\nfraction. The corresponding titania volume fraction of the ceramic\\nink with 64 wt% titania, 68 wt% and 72 wt% titania was 29.59 vol%,\\n33.44 vol% and 37.80 vol%, respectively. According to rheological\\nresults in Fig. 2(f), the elastic modulus of ceramic ink with 68 wt%\\ntitania\\nand\\ntitania\\nwas\\napproximately\\n2.50 � 105 Pa, respectively. We regarded 29.59 vol% as a critical\\nFig. 2. The viscosity of the titania ceramic ink vs. shear rate, (a) different content of SHMP dispersant, (c) different content of SA binder, (e) different content of titania; The elastic\\nmodulus (G0) of titania ceramic ink vs. stress amplitude, (b) different content of SHMP dispersant, (d) different content of SA binder, (f) different content of titania.\\nT. Chen et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 783 (2019) 321e328\\x0cvolume fraction, taking the ceramic ink volume fraction 33.44 vol%,\\n37.80 vol% into the equation for evaluation. Here, k was a constant,\\nx was the scaling exponent (~2.5). After calculation, we obtained\\nthat k was about 4 � 107. This indicated that the capabilities of\\ntitania ceramic ink could also be evaluated by this model. In order\\nto obtain a good printing effect, the elastic modulus of the ceramic\\nink should reach about 105 Pa. The titania volume fraction in\\nceramic ink evaluated by this model was approximately 32.28 vol%\\nwhen the elastic modulus of the ceramic ink reached 105 Pa. This\\nhas a certain instructional signiﬁcance for the direct ink writing of\\ntitania ceramic ink.\\nElastic modulus (G0) of ceramic ink with different titania content\\nwas illustrated in Fig. 2 (f). It was observed that titania ceramic ink\\nwith different solid content all had a plateau of elastic modulus\\nwhen the shear stress was lower than the shear yield stress (ty),\\nwhich represented linear viscoelastic properties. In the linear\\nviscoelastic region, the elastic modulus of titania ceramic ink nearly\\nremained constant as the shear stress increased. However, the\\nshear elastic modulus decreased sharply from the shear yield stress,\\nwhich represented the beginning of irreversible plastic deforma-\\ntion. Among the prepared titania ceramic ink, the ink containing\\n72 wt% titania had the highest equilibrium elastic modulus of\\napproximately 1.65 � 106 Pa and shear yield stress of about 310 Pa.\\nThe elastic modulus of titania ceramic ink in the linear viscoelastic\\nregion were in the magnitude range of 104 Pa and 106 Pa. As illus-\\ntrated in Fig. 2 (f), the shear yield stress of titania ceramic inks were\\napproximately 10 Pa, 20 Pa, 50 Pa, 100 Pa and 310 Pa, respectively.\\nThe shear elastic modulus and shear yield stress of titania ceramic\\nink all increased with the content of titania powder, which was\\nhelpful to fabricate titania ceramic parts via direct ink writing.\\nHowever, it didn't mean that the higher the shear elastic modulus\\nwas, the better the direct ink writing was. In actual experiment\\nprocess, titania ceramic ink with beyond 72 wt% titania powder\\ncontent was not ﬁt for direct ink writing due to nozzle clogging\\nduring printing. The ceramic ink with low titania content (56 wt%\\nand 60 wt%) was also not suitable due to lower elastic modulus,\\nlarge deformation and collapse defects were observed during\\nprinting process. High titania loading ceramic ink (64 wt%, 68 wt%\\nand 72 wt%) all could be utilized to print titania ceramic structures\\nby 3D direct ink writing. The actual printing effect of ceramic ink\\nwith different titania content was illustrated in Fig. 3. At the same\\ntime, it was also an effective way to directly evaluate the capabil-\\nities for direct ink writing of ceramic ink. The supporting capabil-\\nities of ceramic ink and the printing effect were gradually improved\\nwith the increase of titania content. When titania content reached\\n64 wt%, 68 wt% and 72 wt%, it was obvious that the ceramic ink\\ncould be completely formed through direct ink writing without\\ndefects such as collapse and large deformation. In this paper,\\nceramic ink containing 72 wt% titania content was used to generate\\nthree dimensional ceramic structures by the nozzle of 1 mm in this\\nkind of additive manufacturing method, as shown in Fig. 4. When\\nprinting the lattice truss structures, a high elastic modulus is\\nespecially important to maintain the shape after the ink passes\\nthrough the nozzle, which can also reduce effectively the midspan\\ndeﬂection of a suspended strut for a desired span length [40].\\n3.2. Shrinkage and density\\nDuring the experiment, ceramic ink containing 72 wt% titania\\nsolid content with good rheological properties was selected for\\ndirect ink writing. The sizes of the printed samples were larger than\\nthat designed, which indicated that the printed sample has a\\ncertain degree of deformation and spreading. After the sintering\\nprocess, there was obvious volumetric shrinkage occurred in sin-\\ntered samples.

The volumetric shrinkage of the sample increased as the\\nsintering temperature increased from 1000 �C to 1400 �C, it was\\ncated that titania ceramic parts became more dense as sintering\\ntemperatures increased. The porosity and density of titania sintered\\nat different temperatures were shown in Fig. 5(b), the sintering\\nprocess of titania ceramics was the physicochemical process of\\npores expelled, density increased and grain growth. As illustrated\\nin Fig. 5(b), density of titania ceramic at 1400 �C reached 91.5% of\\nthe theoretical density, and this value just reached 43.4% when\\nsintering temperature was 1000 �C. When it came to the term of\\nporosity, it was observed that the porosity of titania ceramic sam-\\nples had an obvious drop when the sintering temperature\\nFig. 3.

The value of porosity decreased from 56.5% to 8.4% when\\nthe sintering temperature increased from 1000 �C to 1400 �C,\\nwhich was also corresponding to the experimental results of\\nvolumetric shrinkage and density. It was beneﬁcial to exhaust\\npores, reduce the shrinkage and improve density of titania ceramic\\nbody when increasing the sintering temperature.\\n3.3. Microstructure and mechanical properties\\nThe microstructure of the samples was characterized by scan-\\nning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 6 showed microstructure of\\ntitania ceramic sintered at different temperatures, which indicated\\nthat the increase of sintering temperature promoted the growth of\\ntitania grains. However, the growth of titania grains was not\\nobvious at sintering temperatures of 1000 �C and 1100 �C, and the\\ndegree of sintering was relatively insufﬁcient. The process of grain\\ngrowth of titania during sintering was also accompanied by pore\\ndischarge and volume shrinkage in the ceramic body, so a well-\\ncrystallized rutile titania ceramic was obtained through high tem-\\nperature sintering. It was found that the grain morphology changed\\nwith the sintering temperature, the grains of titania ceramics were\\nrod-shaped at lower sintering temperature, and when the sintering\\ntemperature increased, the grains grew and gradually transformed\\ninto polygons. The size and morphology of the grains had an\\nimportant inﬂuence on the mechanical properties of the titania\\nceramics, which would be discussed in mechanical properties.\\nThe specimens used to test the compressive strength were\\nprinted into a cylinder of 20 mm in diameter and 40 mm in height\\nat the printing speed of 5 mm s�1. However, the sample size after\\nprinting was about 26.9 mm in diameter and 40.2 mm in height. It\\nwas obvious that the lateral deformation is more severe than the\\nlongitudinal direction. And sintered specimens were polished by\\nFig. 4. Titania ceramic parts printed by 3D direct ink writing using titania ceramic ink.\\nFig. 5.

The test machine\\nused to test compressive strengths of titania ceramic parts was\\nshown in Fig. 7(a). For the reliability of the experimental results,\\nboth ends of the specimen must be parallel to each other. There\\nwere ﬁve parallel specimens at each sintering temperature. In\\nFig. 7(b), compressive force-displacement responses were illus-\\ntrated, it was observed that compressive force of samples sintered\\nat 1300 �C was the highest among samples sintered at other\\ntemperatures.\\nBased\\nthe\\ncompressive\\nforce-displacement\\nre-\\nsponses and the sizes of titania ceramic parts used to stress test, the\\ncompressive strengths of titania ceramic sintered at different\\ntemperatures could be calculated. Then, the elastic modulus of the\\ntitania ceramic sample was obtained, according to the compressive\\nstrength and strain value. The mechanical properties results were\\nshown in Fig. 8, including compressive strength and elastic\\nmodulus, it was apparent that there was a tendency to increase ﬁrst\\nFig. 6.

Compressive strength of titania ceramic varied between\\nabout 10.60 MPa and 125.00 MPa, which had the highest value at\\nsintering temperature of 1300 �C. This could be ascribed to that\\nsmall porosity and titania grain stacked tightly, which was also\\ncorresponding to the test results of Fig. 5. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the\\ngrain size and morphology changed with sintering temperature, it\\nwas analyzed that titania ceramic parts with high compressive\\nstrength had appropriate grain size and polygonal grain shape. The\\ncompressive strengths of sintered samples from 1000 �C to 1200 �C\\nwas remarkably increased due to pores released continually and\\ngrain growth. However, the compressive strength of titania ceramic\\nsintered at 1400 �C was lower than the samples sintered at 1300 �C,\\nwhich indicated that it would adversely affect the compressive\\nstrength performance when the grain grew to a certain extent. The\\nelastic modulus of titania ceramic sintered at different tempera-\\ntures was in a range of 1.22 GPa and 6.87 GPa. It was close to the\\nelastic modulus of human cancellous bone, which was in range of\\n0.28 GPa and 1.86 GPa [30]. It contributed to titania ceramic parts\\nmade by direct ink writing being a promising biomaterials for bone\\nimplants.\\nIn this work, high solid loading (72 wt%) titania ceramic ink with\\nfavorable rheological behavior was prepared for direct ink writing,\\nwhose shear elastic modulus and shear yield stress were approxi-\\nmately 1.65 � 106 Pa and 310 Pa, respectively. Titania ceramic was\\nobtained utilizing high solid loading titania ceramic ink by direct\\nink writing and sintered at high temperature. These samples\\noccurred remarkably volumetric shrinkage from 12.0% to 52.6% at\\ndifferent temperatures. The value of porosity decreased from 56.5%\\nto 8.4% when the sintering temperature increased from 1000 �C to\\n1400 �C. Titania ceramic's density reached 91.5% of the theoretical\\ndensity when sintered at 1400 �C. Appropriate grain size was\\nbeneﬁcial to improve the compressive strength, samples sintered at\\n1300 �C exhibited the highest compressive strength of 125.00 MPa.\\nThe elastic modulus of sintered samples was in a range of 1.22 GPa\\nand 6.87 GPa, which was much lower than traditional metal bio-\\nmaterials and close to the elastic modulus of human cancellous\\nbone, this contributed to titania ceramic being a promising medical\\nmaterial.\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis research is funded by National Natural Science Foundation\\nof China (Grant no., 11874366, 11574331).
